		<h1>Austin All-Girl Hack Night</h1>
		<p>is a group of female developers who get together to code and to talk about code.
			We may see each other around town at other meetups, and some of us may even be coworkers, but for some of the rest of us, this is the only time we see another woman sitting at her computer actually doing development.
			It's really kind of cool.</p>
		<p>Hack nights are varied in terms of attendance, structure, and location.
			We've had long introductions to technologies and very short whiteboard talks.
			Sometimes we all just sit around and talk.
			Sometimes everyone's looking at her computer.
			We have drinks and cupcakes, we meet in various offices around town, and we do tech stuff.</p>
		<p>This group came, indirectly, out of the hack night that followed the first Texas JavaScript conference. 
			People came into a coworking space, some opened their laptops and got to work, some just stood around drinking and talking about technology.
			It was awesome! 
			But, as with almost every technology event under the sun, most of the folks there were men.
			And the thought was, what if we could do this with women?
			What if there was a way for the community - not of a specific technology, but of <em>all</em> the women developers, regardless of technology - to do that same thing?
			What if we just hung out and met each other and worked together, or at least next to each other?
			<strong>How awesome would that be?</strong></p>
		<p>Well, it <em>is</em> awesome.
			Sometimes it's big, sometimes it's small, sometimes it's productive, sometimes we just get sugared up and make nerd jokes.
			But now we all know each other, and we get sick of only seeing boys everywhere, we know where to find each other.</p>
		<p>We're always excited to welcome new members, whether they just got into development or have been doing it since Bell Labs.
			RSVP if you can, if you can't, just show up. 
			Bring your laptop. If you don't drink or don't eat sugar, bring something to eat or drink.</p>
		<p>If you wish there was an All-Girl Hack Night in your town, you should totally start one.
			We'll add you to the github organization, and anywhere else you want!
			If you wish there was an All-Mariners-Fan Hack Night or an All-Left-Handed Hack Night, you should start one!
			Most of us know the other people in the community of our programming language, server framework, etc.
			Sometimes it's nice to meet people we have something else in common with.</p>
